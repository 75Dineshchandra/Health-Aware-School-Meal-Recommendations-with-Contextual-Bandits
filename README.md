# Health-Aware-School-Meal-Recommendations-with-Contextual-Bandits


        The goal of this project is to develop a free and open source analysis and recommendation tool that can be used 
        by non-technical school nutritionists, cafeteria staff, and researchers to optimize school meal offerings for 
        both student preference and healthiness. The tool will leverage Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) algorithms 
        to recommend meals that balance popularity and nutrition. Our project is affiliated with Fairfax County Public 
        Schools (FCPS), which provides the historical meal sales data used in this project. Built by data scientists, the 
        tool is designed to be used by non-technical stakeholders, empowering them to make data-driven decisions to 
        improve student nutrition while maintaining participation.

        Develop or refine a methodological approach using CMAB to recommend meals based on contextual features such as 
        school, time of day, and day of the week, while incorporating a healthiness weighting into the reward function.  

        Integrate this CMAB-based recommendation system into an open source library for school nutrition 
        research, so that future stakeholders can use your methodology to make healthier, data-informed decisions.
